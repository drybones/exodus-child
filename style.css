This stylesheet is loaded instead of the parent theme's stylesheet, which is imported above.
To override styles, copy them here from the original stylesheet, then change the properties.

Similarly, you can modify stylesheets in /css and /colors. For example, you could create a file
in this child theme at css/responsive.css containing @import url("../../exodus/css/responsive.css");
